![Latest Render](./image.png?raw=true)

> Simple raytracer written in rust, able to load simple json map files and render them.

## Build
Building in release mode improves performance by a major factor. To build this renderer run.
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/vgarleanu/raytracer
cargo build --release
```
To run, either use `cargo --run` or `target/debug/raytracer`.

## Example
To render the basic built in demo map just run
This command will render the default map with 400 rays per pixel at a resolution of 400x400, and will use 16 threads:
```
raytracer -o image_file.jpg --threads 16 -x 400 -y 400 -r 400
```
To load a custom map run:
```
raytracer -m ./map.json -o image_file.jpg
```
For more options run
```
raytracer -h
```
